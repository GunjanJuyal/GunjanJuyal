- 👋 Hi, I’m Gunjan Juyal! Thanks for dropping by to check out this page :)
- 👀 I am - a software engineer with over a decade of experience in product development and data engineering. Worked at startups, consulted at large enterprises.
- 🌱 This repo is a scratchpad of some of my play-work. I hope to some day give back some love to the open source community, for all the good that they've done in this world <3
- 💞️ I am currently based out of India, but seeking full-time employment opportunities in the US/Canada. Will need work auth. If you have relevant open positions then please reach out on LinkedIn to explore this further (and Thank You!)
